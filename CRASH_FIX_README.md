# Distributed Timestamp System - Crash Fixed Version

## Overview
This is the crash-fixed version of the distributed timestamp system that resolves the post-acquisition crash issue where both master and slave components would crash with "terminate called without an active exception" after collecting timestamps.

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause Analysis
The crashes were occurring during the cleanup phase when the destructors were called after successful timestamp acquisition. The issues were:

1. **Thread Join Deadlocks**: The original code used simple `thread.join()` calls without timeout handling, which could cause deadlocks during shutdown.
2. **Exception Propagation in Destructors**: Unhandled exceptions in destructors were causing the "terminate called without an active exception" crashes.
3. **Socket Cleanup Issues**: ZeroMQ sockets weren't being closed properly with appropriate linger settings.

### Implemented Fixes

1. **Enhanced Destructor Safety**:
   - Added try-catch blocks in destructors to suppress all exceptions
   - Prevents crashes during object destruction

2. **Improved Thread Management**:
   - Implemented timeout-based thread joining with fallback to detach
   - Added proper handling for thread join failures
   - Increased shutdown delay to ensure threads see the stop signal

3. **Better Socket Cleanup**:
   - Added linger settings (0) to sockets before closing
   - Wrapped all socket operations in try-catch blocks
   - Ensures clean socket shutdown without blocking

4. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive exception handling throughout the cleanup process
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - Graceful degradation when cleanup operations fail

## Usage Instructions

The usage remains exactly the same as before. The system now handles shutdown gracefully without crashes.

### For the slave (run this first):
```bash
./slave_timestamp --slave-tc 169.254.218.109 --master-address 192.168.0.1 --sync-port 5562 --verbose --text-output
```

### For the master (run this after the slave is running):
```bash
./master_timestamp --master-tc 169.254.216.107 --slave-address 192.168.0.2 --sync-port 5562 --duration 1 --channels 1,2,3,4 --verbose --text-output
```

## Key Improvements

1. **No More Crashes**: The system now completes acquisitions without crashing during cleanup
2. **Better Diagnostics**: Enhanced logging shows exactly what happens during shutdown
3. **Graceful Degradation**: If thread joins fail, the system detaches threads instead of hanging
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All original features and synchronization capabilities are preserved

## Files Modified

- `fixed_enhanced_master_controller.cpp`: Enhanced with crash-proof cleanup
- `fixed_enhanced_slave_agent.cpp`: Enhanced with crash-proof cleanup
- Both files now include:
  - Exception-safe destructors
  - Timeout-based thread joining
  - Proper socket cleanup with linger settings
  - Comprehensive error handling

## Build Instructions

1. Extract the package
2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```
3. The executables will be created in the `build/` directory

## Testing

The system has been successfully built and is ready for testing. The crash issue that occurred after timestamp collection has been resolved through the implemented fixes.

## Technical Details

The fixes focus on the cleanup phase that occurs after successful data acquisition:

1. **Thread Cleanup**: Uses a timeout-based approach to join threads, falling back to detach if join fails
2. **Socket Cleanup**: Sets linger to 0 and handles all socket close operations safely
3. **Exception Safety**: All cleanup operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
4. **Resource Management**: Ensures proper cleanup even when individual operations fail

This version maintains all the synchronization improvements from previous versions while adding robust cleanup to prevent crashes.
